Acceptance of any terms or conditions different from those contained herein by CastHost will not be deemed by provision of service, but only by electronic or written signature of an officer of CastHost. You must register and accept the terms of this Agreement and the AUP in order to use the Services. BY REGISTERING FOR AND USING THE SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT AND THE AUP AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AS WELL AS ALL POLICIES AND GUIDELINES OF THE AUP, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. CastHost may modify any of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and the AUP, at any time in its sole discretion. Any modifications are effective upon posting of the revisions on the CastHost web site (the " Site "). Your continued use of the Services following CastHost posting of any modifications constitutes your acceptance of the modifications. If you do not agree to the terms of any modification, do not continue to use the services and immediately notify CastHost of your termination of this Agreement in the manner described below.</p>

To provide your notice of termination, you must submit a ticket to the Billing department via the "Contact Us" form to initiate the cancellation of your service, or via a self initiated cancel request through the client portal.

You will pay all subsequent charges for Services in advance on the anniversary day of each cycle. You must pay for the Services by credit card, or paypal.

Your failure to fully pay any fees and taxes within 72 hours from the applicable due date is a material breach of this Agreement, justifying CastHost to suspend its performance and terminate this Agreement. If CastHost terminates for your material breach, you will be required to pay immediately all fees and costs accrued before the termination date, all monthly recurring fees for each month remaining in the term and any other amounts you owe to CastHost under this Agreement. You are responsible for any costs CastHost incurs in enforcing collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and collection agency fees. To reinstate Services, you must pay for 3 months of Service in advance on the first day such Services are reinstated and any fees associated with reinstating Services.</p>
